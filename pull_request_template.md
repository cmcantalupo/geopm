              (e.g. SDBus or NVMLDevicePool)
        - [ ] Non-exempt methods with logic branches have multiple
              tests
        - [ ] Mock objects derived from class have methods added
        - [ ] New public methods have doxygen comments describing
              behavior, inputs, outputs and exceptions raised

    + <details> <summary>New external dependency</summary>

        - [ ] Use of interface exposed by external dependency is
              compatible with the BSD 3 clause license
        - [ ] Shared object dependencies have been added to the build
              system in this or a prior PR
        - [ ] Dependency has one or more last-level-abstraction classes
              if used in C++
        - [ ] Dependency may have last-level-abstraction when used in
              Python if this enables testing
        - [ ] All existing features continue to work when dependency is
              not available

      </details>

    + <details> <summary>A new C++ class added</summary>

        - [ ] Pure virtual interface class has been added with factory method
        - [ ] Unit test constructor provides dependency injection
        - [ ] Unit tests added for all class methods except: non-test
              constructors, private methods or classes that provide a
              last-level-abstraction of an external dependency
              (e.g. SDBus or NVMLDevicePool)
        - [ ] Non-exempt methods with logic branches have multiple
              tests
        - [ ] All dependency classes have already been merged

    + <details> <summary>A new Python class added</summary>

        - [ ] All dependency classes have already been merged
        - [ ] New public methods have __doc__ string comments describing
