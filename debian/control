Description: The geopm runtime package provides many built-in
 features.  An advanced use case is dynamically coordinating hardware
 settings across all compute nodes used by an distributed HPC
 application in response to the application's behavior and resource
 manager requests.  The dynamic coordination is implemented as a
 hierarchical control system for scalable communication and
 decentralized control. The hierarchical control system can optimize
 for various objective functions including maximizing global
 application performance within a power bound or minimizing energy
 consumption with marginal degradation of application performance.
 The root of the control hierarchy tree can communicate with the
 system resource manager to extend the hierarchy above the individual
 MPI application and enable the management of system power resources
 for multiple MPI jobs and multiple users by the system resource
 manager.

Section: libdevel
Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Depends: ${misc:Depends},
         ${shlibs:Depends},
         libgeopm1 (= ${binary:Version})
Description: Development package for the GEOPM Runtime.  This provides
 the programming interface to libgeopm.so.  The package includes the C
 and C++ header files, maunuals for these interfaces and the
 unversioned libgeopm.so shared object symbolic link and the static
 library.
