Guide for Service Administrators
================================

The `geopmaccess(1) <geopmaccess.1.html>`_ command line tool is used
by a system administrator to manage access to the features provided by
the GEOPM Service.  The GEOPM Service does not allow read or write
access for any non-root user until the system administrator explicitly
configures the service using the ``geopmaccess`` command line tool.
This command line interface allows the administrator to set access
permissions for all users, and may extend these default privileges for
specific Unix groups.
